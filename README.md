# galytix
this is my submission for the take home assesment of galytix analytics
sol file contains all the functions that were desired
setup file loads the word2vec pretrained model 
main file runs a function of the sol file
please note that this solutions takes a bit of time to work because the setup file unzips the binary word2vec model containing millions of words
